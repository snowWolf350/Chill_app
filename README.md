# A productivity app 
One day Gohar khan made a playable on youtube. I thought oo cool he made a game all by himself.I open it to see some good pixel art with a nice layout, having tabs for timers, to do lists, music and background changes.<br>
The thing Is, it was all ai generated, that made me mad.I thought to myself I could make something like that. and made this project.<br>
It was pretty fun trying and using unity as an app development tool. 
<h3>Things I learnt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using built in interfaces to make draggavle windows.</li>
<li>efficiently storing and using data using scriptable objects</li>
</ul>
